# Statistics_Python_Labs

This repository contains the code for the Statistics Python Labs, specifically for the TP3_Stat_GHILENE_CHERMAT notebook.
![My Project](https://github.com/rayaneghilene/ENSEA_AI_Labs/blob/283948d09f73231c4cfba91becbe4bb01973b4f4/Ensea_linkedin_banner10.png)

## Overview
The TP3_Stat_GHILENE_CHERMAT notebook focuses on statistical analysis using Python. It covers various statistical concepts and techniques, providing practical examples and exercises.

## Contents
The notebook includes the following sections:

1. Data Exploration: This section involves loading and exploring the dataset, examining its structure, and gaining insights into the variables.

2. Descriptive Statistics: Here, you will find code for calculating and interpreting descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency, measures of dispersion, and quartiles.

3. Hypothesis Testing: This section covers hypothesis testing using the t-test and chi-square test. It includes examples and step-by-step instructions on conducting these tests in Python.

4. Correlation Analysis: You will learn how to calculate and interpret correlation coefficients between variables, exploring their relationships and dependencies.

5. Regression Analysis: This part focuses on linear regression analysis. It demonstrates how to perform simple linear regression and multiple linear regression, including model evaluation and interpretation.

## Usage
To run the notebook and explore the statistical concepts and techniques covered in TP3_Stat_GHILENE_CHERMAT, follow these steps:
